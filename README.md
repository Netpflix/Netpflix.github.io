# Netpflix
Housing day website for [Pforzheimer House](http://pfoho.harvard.edu) (nicknamed Pfoho), the best of Harvard College's 12 undergraduate houses.

Check it out at [http://netpflix.herokuapp.com](http://netpflix.herokuapp.com), or run it yourself (see below.)

## About
Every March on Housing Day, Harvard freshmen learn which upperclassman House they will be assigned to (if Pfoho, this is cause for great celebration; if not, well, hopefully you have friends there.)

Prior to Housing Day, every House releases a Housing Day video to get students excited about the Houses. [Pfoho always has the best Housing Day videos](http://www.thecrimson.com/flyby/article/2014/3/15/2014-housing-day-video-rankings/), but why stop there? For 2016, we're releasing our very own Housing Day website to accompany the video. Enjoy!

Thank you to all of Pfoho HoCo (housing committee) and everyone in Pfoho for their suggestions and feedback for the parody posters and design of the website!

Special shoutout to my friends with Netflix accounts who showed me what the interface looks like, since I don't intend to get a Netflix account anytime soon.

Pflove,
