# Netpflix
Housing day website for [Pforzheimer House](http://pfoho.harvard.edu) (nicknamed Pfoho), the best of Harvard College's 12 undergraduate houses.

Check it out at [netpflix.com](http://www.netpflix.com), or run it yourself (see below.)

## About
Every March on Housing Day, Harvard freshmen learn which upperclassman House they will be assigned to (if Pfoho, this is cause for great celebration; if not, well, hopefully you have friends there.)

Prior to Housing Day, every House releases a Housing Day video to get students excited about the Houses. [Pfoho always has the best Housing Day videos](http://www.thecrimson.com/flyby/article/2014/3/15/2014-housing-day-video-rankings/), but why stop there? This year, we're releasing our very own Housing Day website to accompany the video. Enjoy!
